# Bilingual Wikipedia Data

This directory is intended for aligned bilingual Wikipedia data (e.g. Bangla–English sentence pairs) used for cross-lingual training.

Possible contents:

- Parallel text files with one sentence pair per line.
- Alignment metadata (e.g. article or paragraph IDs).
- Intermediate artifacts from alignment scripts.

Document the exact format of any files you add here in this README (schema, delimiter, encoding, etc.).
