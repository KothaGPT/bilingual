# Wikipedia Dataset Analysis

This directory is intended for analysis artifacts related to the Wikipedia dataset, for example:

- Exploratory data analysis notebooks or scripts.
- Plots and statistics (length distributions, vocabulary stats, etc.).
- Reports comparing different preprocessing configurations.

Artifacts here should be safe to regenerate from the raw / processed data and scripts.
